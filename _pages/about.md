I'm currently a PhD Computer Science student at [The University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/) under the guidance of [Professor Mohammad Alian (Cornell University)](https://alian.csl.cornell.edu/). My research interest is computer architecture and systems with a concentration on processor microarchitecture, computer system simulation, profiling/sampling workload, and performance/power models.
