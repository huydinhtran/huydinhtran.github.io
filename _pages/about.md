I'm currently a PhD Computer Science student at University of Kansas under the guidance of [Professor Mohammad Alian (Cornell University)](https://alian.csl.cornell.edu/). I completed my MS and BS degrees from University of California, Riverside and Pennsylvania State University, respectively. My research interest is computer architecture and systems with a concentration on processor microarchitecture design, computer system simulation, profiling/sampling workload, and performance/power models.
