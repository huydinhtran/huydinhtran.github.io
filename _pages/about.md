I'm currently a first-year PhD Computer Science student at [The University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/). I'm currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the guidance of [Professor Mohammad Alian](https://alian-eecs.ku.edu/). My research interest is computer architecture with a concentration on computer system simulation, profiling workload, and performance/power models.
