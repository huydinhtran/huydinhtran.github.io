Hi! I'm currently a first-year PhD Computer Science student at [The University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/). I'm currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant. My area of interest is Computer Architecture with a concentration on computer system simulation, profiling workload, and performance/power models.
