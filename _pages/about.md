I'm currently a first-year PhD Computer Science student at [The University of Kansas](https://ku.edu/). I'm currently working as a Graduate Research Assistant under the guidance of [Professor Mohammad Alian](https://alian-eecs.ku.edu/). My research interest is computer architecture and systems with a concentration on computer system simulation, profiling workload, and performance/power models. My current research focuses on standard methodology for benchmarking and evaluating large-scale systems.
