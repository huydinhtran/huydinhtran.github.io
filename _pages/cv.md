Experience
======
* 08/2023 - present: Graduate Research Assistant
  The University of Kansas
  Supervisor: Professor Mohammad Alian

* 08/2022 - 09/2022: CPU Research Intern
  Futurewei Technologies, Inc.
- Simulating CPU architecture in Linux Full-System mode using Gem5 on RISC-V architecture
- Cross-compiling binaries of SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks to RISC-V for measuring the performance of CPU designs
- Integrated SimPoint to create checkpoints at ROIs for speeding up the simulation while still representing the workloads

* 03/2022 - 03/2023: Graduate project - Building custom GPU power models with AccelWattch
  The University of California, Riverside
  Supervisor: Professor Daniel Wong
- Implemented a GPU power model of an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti using a power modeling framework, AccelWattch
- Performed hardware profiling on real GPU to grasp the performance, real power, and hardware performance counters
- Simulated benchmarks on GPGPU-Sim to estimate constant, static, dynamic power consumptions using power model
- Achieved an average MAPE of 63.42% between simulated and real power results
